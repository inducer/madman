II. Building and installing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build madman, you need

- XMMS. [http://www.xmms.org]
  Version 1.2.10 and above.
  IMPORTANT: Version 1.2.9 causes random crashes. Do not use it.
  [Debian package: xmms-dev]

- Qt. [http://www.trolltech.com]
  Version 3.2.x tested, others might work, too. (patches welcome)
  [Debian pacakge: libqt3-mt-dev, NOT libqt3-dev]
  
- TagLib [http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html]
  Current CVS TagLib. (TagLib's CVS is within KDE's kdesupport
  module)
  [Debian package: libtag1-dev]
  *** Plain TagLib 1.1 will appear to compile, but give you 
      relocation errors later on. 

First, you need to know that madman does not use the common autoconf/automake 
build system that many other projects use, mostly for technical reasons.
That means that building madman is different from just typing "configure;
make; make install".

Here's how it works:

1) GET SCONS

   First, you need to have a copy of the SCons build system. If you don't have 
   it installed already, don't hurry to the web yet. madman comes with a local
   version of SCons that you may use.

   IF YOU DON'T HAVE SCONS:
     Go to the madman source directory and type "./configure".
     This will tell you again that you're not building using autoconf and offer
     to extract a local version of SCons. Hit Enter and say "y" when it asks 
     whether to extract a local version of SCons.

   IF YOU DO HAVE SCONS ALREADY:
     You don't need to do anything in this step. In the following steps, whenever
     I say "./scons.py", you should replace that by "scons". So if you're told to
     type "./scons.py install", you'd really type "scons install", because your
     SCons install is system-wide. Also make sure that you have at least SCons 0.95.

2) CONFIGURE AND BUILD MADMAN
   
   Theoretically, just typing
     
     ./scons.py

   should build madman, if the build script manages to find all the dependencies
   mentioned above, so make sure you have them installed. It does work out of the box 
   on Debian systems.

   In case something doesn't work or you want to install somewhere other than 
   "/usr/local", which is the default, you'll need to pass some options to
   the build script. Typing

     ./scons.py -h

   will tell you what options exist. For example, you may type

     ./scons.py prefix=/opt/madman qt_directory=/opt/qt3

   to install to /opt/madman and have the build process use the Qt library at
   /opt/qt3.

   The build system will perform a few checks for the needed components and begin
   building, which would look something like this:

   scons: Reading SConscript files ...
   Checking for Qt at /usr/share/qt3... ok
   Checking for xmms... ok
   Checking for glib... ok
   Checking for C++ header file taglib.h... yes
   Checking for main() in C++ library tag... yes
   scons: done reading SConscript files.
   scons: Building targets ...

   Once you get this far, everything *should* build just fine. You just need to wait
   for
   
   scons: done building targets.

   to show up and the command line to show up again. Once you get this far, you're ready
   to install madman.

   If you'd like, you can test your madman build by saying

   ./main/madman

   madman will run just fine from the build directory, it may however be unable to find
   its plugins, which have not been installed yet.

3) INSTALLING MADMAN SYSTEM-WIDE

   Type

     su -c "./scons.py <SAME OPTIONS AS YOU USED ABOVE> install"

   to become root and install madman system-wide. It is important that you use the 
   exact same options as you used above, otherwise SCons may detect a build-significant
   change and try to rebuild madman from scratch, which is not what you want.

   Once this goes through, madman is installed. Have fun!

Cheat sheet for people used to Autoconf:

  ./configure --help
  BECOMES
  ./scons.py -h

  ./configure --prefix=/here/there --with-taglib-include=/usr/local/include
  BECOMES
  ./scons.py prefix=/here/there taglib_include=/usr/local/include
  
  make
  IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY upon successful configuration.

  make clean
  BECOMES
  ./scons.py -c

  Note that SCons does not honor the CC, C_INCLUDE_PATH or other compiler-related
  environment variables, in order to assure build environment consistency.
